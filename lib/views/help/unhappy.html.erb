    If you <strong>didn’t get a response to your request within 20 working days
    </strong>, the steps that you need to take next will depend on where in the 
    UK the authority is based. Please see our dedicated help page for more 
    information about <a href="<%= help_no_response_path %>">
    what to do if you didn't get a response to your request</a>.

  <p>
    If you <strong>did not get all of the information</strong> that you
    asked for, or your request was <strong>refused without a valid reason</strong>
    you can:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Ask the public authority to carry out an <a href="#internal_review">internal review</a> 
    </li>

    <li>
      If that doesn't help, you can refer the request to the relevant

      Choose <%= link_to "request an internal review", new_request_followup_url(

    <% else %>
      At the bottom of the relevant request page on WhatDoTheyKnow choose
      "request an internal review". Then write a message asking for an internal
      review of your request. You should be as specific as possible about the reasons 
      you are unhappy with the way your request was handled. It may be helpful to include
      a link to the request page, to make it clear which request you are talking about. 
    <% end %>
  </summary>

  <p>
    For requests made to UK Authorities, you don't need to ask for an internal review if the authority 
    hasn't responded to your request at all. You can go straight to the Information Commissioner.
  </p>
  <p>
    For requests made to Scottish public authorities, you <strong>must first ask for
      an internal review</strong> from the authority.
  </p>
  <p>
    There's a good chance an internal review will prompt a change in the public
    body's stance. Based on Scottish data, 
    <a href="https://research.mysociety.org/html/reforming-foi/l/7.62.67c3q.zdv8i.j1tkf.dejgi.html">
    16% of internal reviews</a> result in an entirely substituted decision (and more a partially substituted decision)
    , and based on UK central government data roughly 
    <a href="https://research.mysociety.org/html/reforming-foi/l/7.62.67c3q.zdv8i.j1tkf.dejgi.html">
    25% of internal reviews</a> lead to more information being released.
  </p>

  <p>Internal reviews should be quick. If one takes longer than 20 working days
    then the authority should write and let you know, and it should never take
    longer than 40 working days (see this
    <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-freedom-of-information/refusing-a-request/#20">good practice guide</a>).
    You will then either get the information that
    you originally requested, or you will be told that the review upholds the
    original decision.

<h2 id="refer-to-ico">2. Referring a request to the Information Commissioner <a class="hover_a" href="#refer-to-ico">#</a></h2>

<details>
  <summary>
    If the public authority has completed their internal review and you
    are unhappy with their response, or if the public authority has refused
    to carry out an internal review, you can refer your request to the
    relevant Information Commissioner.
  </summary>
  <p>
    For UK authorities,
    start by reading <a href="https://ico.org.uk/make-a-complaint/foi-and-eir-complaints/foi-and-eir-complaints/">the
    Information Commissioner's advice for those with concerns about accessing
    information</a>, which links to their form.
  </p>
  <p>
    While the Information Commissioner suggests that you fill out their form 
    and attach any supporting evidence, in practice they also consider referrals 
    made via email, to <strong><code>
    <a href="mailto:ICOCasework@ico.org.uk?subject=FOI%2FEIR%20Complaint">
    icocasework@ico.org.uk</a></code></strong>, and accept a link to your request 
    on WhatDoTheyKnow.com as evidence of the correspondence related to the request
    You should clearly explain what part of the response you wish to challenge and why. 
    For example, if you think that the authority has not fully considered all of the public 
    interest arguments in favour of releasing the information, or if you disagree with how
    they have applied a particular exemption, you should state this.
    If you wish to download copies of correspondence, and attachments, to
    send to the Information Commissioner the <code>.zip</code> download
    feature, accessed via "Actions" may assist.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you requested information
    from a Scottish authority, then you should contact
    <a href="https://www.foi.scot/appeal">the
    Scottish Information Commissioner</a> instead.
  </p>
  <p>
    At the moment, you can't make a complaint to the Information Commissioner or
    Scottish Information Commissioner using WhatDoTheyKnow. If you want to keep
    people informed of the progress of your complaint, you can add an annotation to
     the request.
    <a href="https://ico.org.uk/action-weve-taken/decision-notices/">
    Decisions by the Information Commissioner</a> and 
    <a href="https://www.foi.scot/decisions">Scottish Information Commissioner</a> are published 
    online.
  </p>

  <p>
    A warning. Although the Information Commissioner has worked hard to reduce
    their backlog of casework, it can still take several months to get
    resolution from them in many cases. One area where they have sped up things
    considerably is that they are able to prompt non-responsive authorities to
    reply within a few weeks of receiving a complaint.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you reach the point of referring a case to the relevant Information Commissioner,
    you should accept that you won't get the information quickly by this means.
    Maybe you want to help the fight to improve our Freedom of Information
    regime, or maybe getting the information slowly is still worthwhile. You
    can also try and get the information by other means…

<h2 id="other_means">3. Using other means to answer your question <a class="hover_a" href="#other_means">#</a></h2>

<details>
  <summary>
    You can try pursuing your problem or your research in other ways.
  </summary>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Make a <strong>new FOI request</strong> for summary information, or for
      documentation relating indirectly to matters in your refused request.
      <a href="<%= help_contact_path %>">Ask us for ideas</a> if you're stuck.
    </li>

    <li>
      If any <strong>other public authorities</strong> or publicly owned
      companies are involved, then make FOI requests to them.
    </li>

    <li>
      Write to <strong>your MP</strong> or other politician using <a
      href="http://www.writetothem.com">WriteToThem</a> and ask for their help
      finding the answer. MPs can write directly to ministers or departments,
      and can ask written questions in the House of Commons. Councillors in
      local authorities can talk directly to council officers.
    </li>

    <li>
      Ask <strong>other researchers</strong> who are interested in a similar
      issue to yours for ideas. You can sometimes find them by browsing this
      site; contact any registered user from their page. There may be an
      Internet forum or group that they hang out in.
    </li>

    <li>
      You could form a small local campaign group and arrange a meeting
      with staff from the authority.
    </li>
  </ul>
